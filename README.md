Project Euler solutions in Crystal, Ruby and Rust

To paraphrase TrÃ¶ckener Kecks: everything has been done already, but not by me yet; so these are my solutions to a few
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. My goal with these is to improve my Ruby skills, and to learn Crystal and Rust.

Self-imposed restrictions:
* no use of thirdparty libraries, unless they come with the standard installation. For example, 'prime' for Ruby is fine, and so is 'big' for Crystal.
* maintainability > performance
* no guessing of upper bounds, only use upper bounds if they are given in the problem description, or can easily be inferred. Otherwise, the upper bound is infinity.
