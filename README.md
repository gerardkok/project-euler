# project-euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) solutions in Ruby (and a few in Crystal).

| SPOILER ALERT: Although this repository does not contain direct answers to Project Euler problems, it is trivially easy to retrieve them from here by just executing the scripts. If you don't wish to be spoiled, navigate elsewhere. |

My goal is to improve my Ruby skills, and to play a bit with Crystal.

Self-imposed restrictions:
* no use of thirdparty libraries, unless they come with the standard installation. For example, 'prime' for Ruby is fine, and so is 'big' for Crystal.
* readability is a first-class citizen
* performance is a first-class citizen too; writing down a performant solution to a problem not only gives better insight into the problem, but also teaches me which Ruby constructs are best used in which cases
* no guessing of upper bounds, only use upper bounds if they are given in the problem description, or can easily be inferred. Otherwise, the upper bound is infinity
