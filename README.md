# project-euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) solutions in Ruby (and a few in Crystal).

My goal is to improve my Ruby skills, and to play a bit with Crystal.

Self-imposed restrictions:
* no use of thirdparty libraries, unless they come with the standard installation. For example, 'prime' for Ruby is fine, and so is 'big' for Crystal.
* readability is a first-class citizen
* performance is a first-class citizen too; writing down a performant solution to a problem not only gives better insight into the problem, but also teaches me which Ruby constructs are best used in which cases
* no guessing of upper bounds, only use upper bounds if they are given in the problem description, or can easily be inferred. Otherwise, the upper bound is infinity
